				<h3>Product | Engineering</h3>

			<p>I am a product leader with a passion for startups, engineering and product design.</p>
			<p>I spent most of my childhood in Dubai and came to US to study at Carnegie Mellon University. While in school, I had the opportunity to work at a couple of amazing companies like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> and <a href="http://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a>.</p>
			<p>After graduating, I hiked east to New York City to work as a software engineer at <a href="http://www.renttherunway.com" target="_blank">Rent The Runway</a>, a startup with a goal of democratizing high fashion. After working there for about a year, I joined <a href="#">Oyster (now acq. by Google) </a> as it's first platform engineer and grew within the company to become it's first product manager.</p>
			<p>In my spare time, I enjoy enjoy boxing, basketball and reading.</p>
